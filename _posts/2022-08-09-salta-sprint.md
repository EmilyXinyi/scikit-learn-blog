In September of 2022, the [SciPy Latin America](https://pythoncientifico.ar/) conference will take place in Salta, Argentina.
As part of the event, we are organizing a [Scikit-learn Sprint](https://pythoncientifico.ar/events/sprints/) for the people attending.
The main idea is to introduce the participants to the open source world and help them make their first contribution.
