## Sponsors
- Dataiku provided the space and some of the food, as well as all of the coffee.
- The scikit-learn consortium paid for the lunch, the travel and accommodation expenses.

## Topics covered at the sprint
- PR #13649: [Monotonic constraints for Tree-based models](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/13649) 
- Discussed the vision/future directions for the project. What is important to keep the project relevant in the future.
- Should we share some points beyond the vision statement?
- Thomas F will try and create a vision statement
- Discussed what people are keeping an eye on with a two year time scale in mind in terms of technology and developments that are relevant.
- Tim: keep improving our documentation (not just expanding it but also “gardening” to keep it readable)
- Tim: increase active outreach and communication about new features/improvements and other changes. A lot of cool things in scikit-learn are virtually unknown to the wider public (e.g. Hist grad boosting being on par with lightgbm in terms of performance, …)


### What is next?

We are discussing co-locating with OpenML next Sep to Dec 2024 in Berlin to organize another developers' sprint.
