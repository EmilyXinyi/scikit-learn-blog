## Blog Standards
:warning: **NOTE:** Individual Category *(blog/category/name.md)* and Tag *(blog/tag/name.md)* pages are automatically generated by a Github Action. Please do not manually add add markdown pages.

### Categories
Categories are broad groupings of posts. A post should have only one category. If the post could potentially fall under multiple categories, please select the one that best describes it.

#### Current Categories
- scikit-learn Updates
- Community Post

### Tags
Tags describe specific details of a post. They help to link related posts together and aid in user search. A post can have multiple tags or no tags. While there is no strict limit, we recommend using no more than 10 tags per post.



## Installation

#### Installing Ruby & Jekyll

If this is your first time using Jekyll, please follow the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and make sure your local environment (including Ruby) is setup correctly.

### Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies (if you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again), then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.


### Theme Documentation

This blog is uses the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). For more information on configuration/customization, please reference the [theme documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).
