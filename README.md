## Blog Standards
Categories and Tags help us organize our blog by grouping related content to make it easier to discover.     

:warning: **NOTE:** Individual Category *(blog/category/name.md)* and Tag *(blog/tag/name.md)* pages are automatically generated by a Github Action. Please do not manually add add markdown pages.

### Categories
Categories are broad groupings of posts. A post should have only one category. If the post could potentially fall under multiple categories, please select the one that best describes it.

#### Example Categories
- Updates
- Events
- Team

### Tags
Tags describe specific details of a post. They help to link related posts together and aid in user search. A post can have multiple tags or no tags. While there is no strict limit, we recommend using no more than 10 tags per post.

**Example Tags:** Sprints, Community, Open Source, New Member
