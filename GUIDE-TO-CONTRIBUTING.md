# Blog Standards
This section contains scikit-learn's standards and guidelines.

## Categories & Tags
Categories and Tags help us organize our blog by grouping related content to make it easier to discover.

:warning: **NOTE:** Individual Category *(blog/category/name.md)* and Tag *(blog/tag/name.md)* pages are automatically generated by a Github Action. Please do not manually add add markdown pages.

### Categories
Categories are broad groupings of posts. A post should have only one category. If the post could potentially fall under multiple categories, please select the one that best describes it.

*Example Categories:* Updates, Events, Team

### Tags
Tags describe specific details of a post. They help to link related posts together and aid in user search. A post can have multiple tags or no tags. While there is no strict limit, we recommend using no more than 10 tags per post.

*Example Tags:* Sprints, Community, Open Source, New Member, Machine Learning, New Feature

    - *title:* Add the title of your blog post in double quotes, 
        - `title: "Example Post Title"` (with quotes)
    - *date:* Add the date of posting. This helps to ensure our blog displays posts are sorted correctly and are displayed in a sequential order.
        - `date: Month Name, Day, Year` (no quotes) 
2. **Add Post Category and Tags:** Categories and tags help us organize our blog by grouping related content to make it easier to discover. Check the [Blog Standards](https://github.com/scikit-learn/blog#blog-standards) section for more information.
